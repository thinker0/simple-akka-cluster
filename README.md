Setting up Akka clustering is quite easy and provides a way to distribute work across multiple machines in the cluster. In many cases this requires no changes to an Actor compared to a non-cluster deployment. In this screencast, I walk through setting up a cluster and compare deploying an actor in a local actor system and a clustered actor system.
